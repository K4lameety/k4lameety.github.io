* **Capture The Flag (CTF):** Actively participating in competitions (Jeopardy style).
* **Digital Forensics:** Analyzing artifacts, memory dumps, and network traffic to solve mysteries.
* **Web Security:** Understanding web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, etc.) and how to patch them.
* **Security Engineering:** Deploying and managing security monitoring tools like **Wazuh** & Suricata.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Some of the technologies I use in my daily research:

* **Languages:** Python, Bash, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
* **Security Tools:** Burp Suite, Wireshark, Ghidra, Volatility
* **Infrastructure:** Linux, Proxmox, Docker
