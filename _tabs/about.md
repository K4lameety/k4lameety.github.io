## 👋 Who am I?

Hi there! I'm **K4lameety**.

I am a **Cyber Security Enthusiast** and **Developer** based in Indonesia. My journey involves solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, investigating digital artifacts, and building tools to automate security workflows.

Currently, I am undergoing an intensive specialization to become a **Lead Forensic Investigator**, with a deep interest in **Digital Forensics** and **Reverse Engineering**.

## 🚀 Focus & Interests

I spend most of my time exploring these areas:

* **Digital Forensics:** Investigating file systems, memory dumps, and network traffic to reconstruct cyber incidents.
* **Reverse Engineering:** Deconstructing malware and binary files to understand their inner workings.
* **Capture The Flag (CTF):** Participating in competitions as a way to sharpen my technical edge under pressure.
* **Security Engineering:** Deploying and managing security monitoring tools like **Wazuh** and Suricata for threat detection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Some of the technologies and tools I use in my research:

* **Forensics:** Wireshark, Volatility 3, Autopsy, ImHex, Exiftool.
* **Reversing:** Ghidra, IDA Free, GDB, Strings.
* **Languages:** Python (for automation), Bash, JavaScript.
* **Infrastructure:** Linux, Proxmox, Docker.
