# 🛡️ Mission Objective: Mastering the Bytes

Today, December 25, 2025, marks a significant turning point in my cybersecurity career. I am shifting my focus from being a "CTF player chasing flags" to becoming a dedicated **Lead Forensic Investigator**.

Digital Forensics is not just about finding hidden strings; it is about methodology, data integrity, and the ability to reconstruct the truth from the digital breadcrumbs left behind.

## 🗺️ The 4-Month Specialization Roadmap

I have designed an intensive learning strategy that will run from January to April 2026. Every week, I will share my investigation logs and technical findings on this blog.

### 🟢 Month 1: Foundation & Disk Forensics (January)
Focusing on the most fundamental level of data: **Bits and Bytes**.
- **Topics:** Magic Bytes identification, Manual File Carving, Metadata Analysis, and Windows Artifacts.
- **Goals:** To perform manual data restoration of corrupted files without relying solely on automated tools.

### 🔵 Month 2: Network Investigation (February)
Focusing on **Data in Motion**.
- **Topics:** Packet Inspection (Wireshark/Tshark), Object Extraction, DNS Tunneling detection, and Log Analysis.
- **Goals:** To detect network anomalies and perform efficient triage on network-based incidents.

### 🟡 Month 3: Memory & System Artifacts (March)
Focusing on **Volatile Data**.
- **Topics:** Memory Forensics (Volatility 3), Advanced Windows Registry, Browser Forensics, and Malware Persistence.
- **Goals:** To uncover "fileless" traces of attackers that exist only in RAM.

### 🔴 Month 4: Basic Reverse Engineering (April)
Focusing on **Understanding the Threat**.
- **Topics:** Assembly x86/x64, Static Analysis (Ghidra), Deobfuscation, and Malware Behavior.
- **Goals:** To deconstruct the logic of the weapons (malware) used by adversaries.

## 📋 Investigation Methodology

In every report published here, I will implement **Lead Investigator** standards:
1. **Data Integrity:** Every piece of evidence will be validated using SHA-256 Hashes.
2. **Detailed Reporting:** I will focus on the "Why" and "How," not just the solution.
3. **Chain of Custody:** Maintaining a logical and professional investigative flow.

## 🚀 Learning Commitment

I will dedicate my **Thursdays** and **Sundays** to "Deep Work"—tackling the most complex forensic challenges. This journey will be documented transparently here and on my X account.
